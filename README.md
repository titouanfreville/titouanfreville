[Coding Game](https://www.codingame.com/profile/4a90e43cd348ac7aa183c0843cfc2a641283514)

I am Titouan FREVILLE, a young engineer in computer sciences interested in maths, backend development and machine learning.

I'm currently working as a lead back end developper in Python and Go since 2021.

I love to learn new things every day and I often use langage I don't know in custom project and I recently discovered code wars and coding game so I take some time to play with it :)

I host some open source project on github: https://github.com/elmagician?type=source and colaborated on public project hosted by gitlab: https://gitlab.com/titouanfreville, https://gitlab.com/supinfo-bots.

I am Titouan FREVILLE, a young engineer in computer sciences interested in maths, backend development and machine learning.

I'm currently working as a back end developper in Go since 2020.

I love to learn new things every day and I often use langage I don't know in custom project and I recently discovered code wars and coding game so I take some time to play with it :)
